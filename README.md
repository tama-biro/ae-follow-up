 Follow up to after-effect study

The code in the Final Analysis folder of this repository contains the code to process and analyze the data for the after-effect study.

To reproduce the findings in the paper, the code in the R script can be run. Sometimes, a line of code might need to be commented out or uncommented to make the comparison across certain conditions or not.
